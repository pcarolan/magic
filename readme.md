# Magic

## Setup

1. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to a valid openai key
2. Install ruby `>= ruby 3.3.4`

## About

Magic let's us call any function you can imagine.
It asks another dimension for the answer, and returns the result.
Magic methods can be chained together.

Examples:

```ruby
get_stock_price('GOOGL', as_of_date='2025-11-20')
```

If the method is called without a name it becomes anonymous.
